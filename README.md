# ML Algorithms from Scratch

This repo is a collection of classic machine learning algorithms, all implemented from scratch in Python. It’s actually part of my coursework for the Foundations of Machine Learning class taught by Prof. Sri Rama Murty Kodukula. Working on these really helped me understand how the algorithms work behind the scenes—no shortcuts, just clear code and comments.

## What's Inside

You'll find basic versions of popular algorithms such as:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Fisher's Discriminant Analysis (FDA)
- Perceptron
- Predictive Distribution Analysis
- Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm for GMMs
- Neural Networks (including dropout, early stopping, and regularization)
- Adam Optimizer
- ...and more as I add them!
